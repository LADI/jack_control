"jack_control" is small program for exposing https://jackdbus.ladish.org/[jackdbus] functionality at command-line.

Chained execution of several commands is possible. For example "jack
control ds alsa dps midi-driver raw eps realtime on eps
relatime-priority 70 start" selects ALSA driver, enables JACK MIDI raw
backend, enables realtime mode, sets realtime priority to 70 and
starts JACK server.
